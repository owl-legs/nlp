i have it from the same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor and are alone in london it was furnished partly as a sitting and partly as a bedroom with flowers arranged in every nook and corner as i descended my old ally the came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him we got off our fare and the trap rattled back on its way to leatherhead he held in his hand a of blue paper scrawled over with notes and figures finally he returned to the pawnbrokers and having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his two or three times he went up to the door and knocked there is no between them but they all open out into the same corridor he and i seemed to be the only living things between the arch of the sky and the desert beneath it it may prove the simplest matter in the world but all the same at first glance this is just a little is it not twelve struck and one and two and three and still we sat waiting for whatever might befall she never said a word until we were at the door here when she took me by the hand and me to tell no one what had happened a few faint were gleaming in a violet sky i tell you that he is a and dangerous man i can distinctly remember that as we did so there came three from a neighboring clock my friend was an enthusiastic being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit i should like to have his of the case though the authorities assure me that nothing more can be done he shook hands eagerly with sherlock holmes and his dark eyes sparkled with pleasure when he understood that the specialist was to hear his story a few seconds sufficed to satisfy him for he to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket i went up to the house with the and saw all that was to be seen i found the black tor upon which i had seen the solitary and from its craggy summit i looked out myself across the melancholy downs it swelled up louder and louder a yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek whatever his crimes he has something to atone for them you can imagine my watson when within two inches of my peg i saw a conical depression in the ground the butler brought me my into the library and i took the chance to ask him a few questions the maid had loved the but had afterwards had cause to hate him he hammered loudly at the and pulled at the bell but without any success it was several miles off but i could see a small dark dot against the dull green and gray this of course fitted in well enough with the theory if the colonel could have seen his wife making a murderous attack upon him the chamber was certainly large and the way in which my feet sank into the carpet as i across it told me of its richness the j p shrugged his shoulders and led the way into his own which was a plainly furnished and commonplace room i had the hint from holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbrokers assistant was a man a man who might play a deep game besides i can read in a mans eye when it is his own that he is frightened for the boards round and the of the walls were of brown worm-eaten oak so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house miss hunter screamed and against the wall at the sight of him but sherlock holmes sprang forward and confronted him this second one leads by means of a second small stair to a side door used by and also as a short cut by clerks when coming from charles street was he our enemy or was he by chance our guardian angel as we ran towards it the vague outline into a definite shape holmes pulled a large sheet of out of his pocket and carefully unfolded it upon his knee then i carefully off five to the east and two to the south the instant that we heard it holmes from the bed struck a match and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull he lay back without though he bit his lip from time to time i went at once to my room and drew up my of the mornings conversation for holmes having once made up my mind you know the which i took in order to put the matter to the proof i shall give directions that you may behind when the others go so that you may copy it at your leisure without fear of being overlooked it may be that the solution of the one may to be the solution of the other they say that away down in the village and even in the distant parsonage that cry raised the from their beds fresh scandals have eclipsed it and their more piquant details have the gossips away from this four-year-old drama again and again i have taken a problem to him and have received an which has afterwards proved to be the correct one there he is all and sound he actually sat in an arm-chair and i could hardly get him to speak coherently my mistress told me that you were to call it was one of the main arteries which the traffic of the city to the north and west i stooped in some confusion and began to pick up the fruit understanding for some reason my companion desired me to take the upon myself he had a very dark face and a gleam in his eyes that comes back to me in my dreams the fat man his eyes round and then up at the open skylight we passed up the stair the door followed on down a passage and found ourselves in front of the barricade which miss hunter had described holmes was for the moment as as i his hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation the chimney is wide but is up by four large staples my companion sat in the front of the trap his arms folded his hat down over his eyes and his chin sunk upon his breast buried in the deepest thought he used to make over the cleverness of women but i have not heard him do it of late i have therefore to call upon you and to consult you in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding as i passed out through the wicket gate however i found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the upon the other side a low had fallen upon our ears i realized it as i back and noted how hill after hill showed traces of the ancient people you must find your own ink pens and blotting-paper but we this table and chair i hope to that he has gone for he has brought nothing but trouble here it threw a livid unnatural circle upon the floor while in the beyond we saw the vague loom of two figures which crouched against the wall perhaps our now may do something to make it less obscure that was bad enough for all that the said he had heard nothing and the remained a complete mystery then he over the hill not a not a rustle rose now from the dark figure over which we stooped i mean to teach them in these parts that law is law and that there is a man here who does not fear to it i sat down upon a in the corner and thought the whole matter carefully over the inspector hurried away on the instant to make about the page while holmes and i returned to baker street for breakfast she could trust her own guardianship but she could not tell what or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man when his body had been carried from the cellar we found ourselves still confronted with a problem which was almost as as that with which we had started the back door was open and as he came to the foot of the he saw two men wrestling together outside i read nothing except the criminal and the agony column i confess that they quite my expectations and that i am utterly unable to account for your result was there a police-station near i do not think that i have ever seen so a man it was furred outside by a thick layer of dust and damp and worms had eaten through the wood so that a crop of livid fungi was on the inside of it i dont think i ever faster but the others were there before us i have tried to it from the measurements i am sorry to have you at the end were the of the high dignitaries who had signed it my companion noiselessly the shutters moved the lamp onto the table and cast his eyes round the room the darkness was but much was still hidden by the shadows i was pained at the for i knew how keenly holmes would feel any slip of the kind we had come out upon oxford street and i had ventured some remark as to this being a roundabout way to kensington when my words were by the extraordinary conduct of my companion when i thought of the heavy and looked at the gaping roof i understood how strong and immutable must be the purpose which had kept him in that inhospitable abode when leaving the house she was heard by the coachman to make some commonplace remark to her husband and to him that she would be back before very long was she his his friend or his mistress we had hardly reached the hall when we heard the of a hound and then a scream of agony with a horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to a collection of my trifling achievements would certainly be which contained no account of this very singular business his hair and whiskers were shot with gray and his face was all crinkled and like a withered apple the point is a simple one but the inspector had it because he had started with the supposition that these county magnates had had nothing to do with the matter he went over to the door and turning the he examined it in his methodical way my heart within me as i saw it another day two at the most and i have my case but until then guard your charge as closely as ever a fond mother watched her ailing child sherlock holmes stopped at a door some little distance from the carlton and me not to speak he led the way into the hall the lake there is eight feet deep and you can imagine our feelings when we saw that the of the poor demented girl came to an end at the edge of it four or five minutes afterwards the window will open i rushed out loudly for my stepfather and i met him hastening from his room in his dressing-gown the coachman saw him the hall and enter it he was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cap which he had laid down upon my books more than one person at the mere sight of him so terrible was the effect the smarting of it in an instant all the particulars of my nights adventure and i sprang to my feet with the feeling that i might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers it came out upon the opposite to a second more ornamental stair which came up from the front hall then he himself in his chair and looked them over with a gleam of satisfaction in his eyes twice they tried to get at him and a third time you see it came off joseph harrison is my name and as percy is to marry my sister annie i shall at least be a by marriage they all agreed that only two were to be heard those of barclay and of his wife the skylight above was open and the gone his grandfather was a royal and he himself has been to eton and oxford you must yourself up from him to-night already i was unable to stand erect when my eye caught something which brought a of hope back to my heart mortimer had to dinner and he and the baronet played ecarte afterwards holmes had brought up a long thin and this he placed upon the bed beside him my sister and i you will recollect were twins and you know how are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied the stage lost a fine even as science lost an acute reasoner when he became a specialist in crime for days on end when the mood was on him he has been in the deepest gloom there was a long silence during which holmes his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire we were in time to the major before he reached the corner he said a few words to each candidate as he came up and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would them he was a well-grown handsome man with a splendid forehead and though he has been with us for twenty years he cannot be more than now it has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money and that it is still in our cellar ive always been above my station in life and disgrace would kill me but you know i have been trained as an myself perhaps mr wilson you would have the great kindness to your narrative her father refused to have anything to do with her because she had married without his and perhaps for one or two other reasons as well we had reached the same crowded in which we had found ourselves in the morning if this man were inside it i should find out from his own lips at the point of my if necessary who he was and why he had dogged us so long during two years i have had three and one small job and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me how he did it i could not but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd and right up to the steps which led to the office her face fell however when she saw that i was a and she sat down again and asked me the object of my visit to do this was quite beyond my power and i could only hope that by i might in ten years time save enough to enable me to put up my plate presently he emerged looking even more than before he took a small piece of torn paper from a and spread it out upon his knee he earns his living partly as interpreter in the law courts and partly by acting as to any wealthy orientals who may visit the northumberland avenue hotels it was absolutely certain therefore in spite of her that she must know something of the matter the walls were of wood but the floor consisted of a large iron trough and when i came to examine it i could see a of metallic deposit all over it the barren scene the sense of loneliness and the and urgency of my task all struck a chill into my heart there was something that touched me as i read this letter something in the reiterated appeals to bring holmes i understand that it was on a matter that you wished to speak to me he was and worn but clear and alert his keen face bronzed by the sun and roughened by the wind he is as brave as a and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone i want to see whether the objections are fatal or if they may be away he may have been or he may have been so paralyzed with terror as to have been unable to cry out my evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side and the windows were by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars which were secured every night i read death on his face as plain as i can read that over the fire in the last century however four successive were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the regency between your brandy and your i feel a new man i did not very much however by my inspection naturally it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value but unfortunately i had no by which i could do this they were all three standing in a in front of the altar holmes had sat up upon the couch and i saw him like a man who is in need of air it was quite certain that he had his fate and that it had caused him the utmost horror and when he of irene adler or when he refers to her photograph it is always under the honourable title of the woman how quiet and sweet and the garden looked in the moonlight and it could not be more than thirty feet down you see that his murderer might have torn the rest of the from him or he might have taken this fragment from the murderer the lamps had been but the blinds had not been drawn so that i could see holmes as he lay upon the couch as i set it down again after having examined it my heart leaped to see that beneath it there lay a sheet of paper with upon it with much labour we separated them and carried him living but horribly into the house there is something in it which me extremely mr alec however was a man to play games of that sort with but first as i am rather shaken by the knocking about which i had in the dressing-room i think that i shall help myself to a of your brandy colonel in his hand he held a but he thrust it into his pocket as we advanced there is no possibility of a secret door and the are quite thirty feet from the ground for three hours we strolled about together the ever-changing kaleidoscope of life as it ebbs and flows through fleet street and the strand so interested was he that i had to some of it twice before he was satisfied you can understand that living the life which i have we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position is that a place where a would be likely to take his station a small taper on the edge of the table shed a feeble light which to show me that he was fully dressed i thought the matter over and i came to the conclusion that i must the case from another aspect its not been for two days he has died within ten of being bitten it contained a loaf of bread a tinned tongue and two of preserved peaches the bottle was in my laboratory so leaving my patient seated in his chair i ran down to get it i should be very much obliged if you would your revolver into your pocket i had no in finding her rooms which were central and well appointed the metal work was in the form of a double ring but it had been bent and out of its original shape she knows that the king is of having her waylaid and searched i had no idea of the to which this would carry him until the merest accident opened my eyes to it but i understand holmes that you are turning to practical ends those with which you used to amaze us mr cunningham looking out of his saw the fellow as he gained the road but lost sight of him at once then it through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which i met it we had reached pall mall as we and were walking down it from the st jamess end it was a silent house when it was concluded he settled our new upon the sofa placed a pillow beneath his head and laid a glass of brandy and water within his reach it would indeed be a for me if i could run him to earth where my master had failed why should i slink away without having carried out my commission and without the which was my due i beg you to remember that no one knows where you are and that whether you are in this carriage or in my house you are in my power i was of our little sitting-room and gladly acquiesced then he turned the handle and entered i at his heels with the pistol in my hand i gave a myself so far i could their actions as if i had actually seen them if he is we shall take you away to your aunts at harrow shortly after our return to england my mother died she was eight years ago in a railway accident near crewe major murphy to whom i owe most of my assures me that he has never heard of any misunderstanding between the pair admiration was i the first impression we should not have troubled you only that our friend who speaks greek and who began these has been forced to return to the east on reaching scotland yard however it was more than an hour before we could get inspector gregson and comply with the legal which would enable us to enter the house my nets are upon him even as his are upon sir henry and with your help he is already almost at my mercy then you hand over to me three quarters of what you and you keep the other quarter for yourself i observe that there is a good deal of german on the programme which is rather more to my taste than italian or french we compress the earth into bricks so as to remove them without what they are this also was opened and led down a flight of winding stone which terminated at another formidable gate there were a thousand to save but it was of only one that i was thinking when i dropped over the wall that night but there is if you will my saying so something just a little funny about it on his evidence cartwright was and the other three got fifteen years apiece far away stretched a line of with a light here and there in the upper windows an hour and half had before the inspector returned alone these articles with two small chairs made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of wilton carpet in the centre at the time that i wrote this letter to sir charles i had learned that there was a of my regaining my freedom if certain expenses could be met finally he walked over to the bed and some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall indeed it was almost the effect which this giggling ruffian had produced upon the unfortunate linguist for he could not speak of him save with trembling hands and a blanched cheek the july which immediately succeeded my marriage was made memorable by three cases of interest in which i had the of being associated with sherlock holmes and of studying his methods and first one or two mr wilson it was the most position in which i ever found myself in my life and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now left his at ten oclock at night and has not been heard of since so much is clear i really had not the to follow it up save in a very incomplete fashion but it gave me a basis for some pleasing speculation the matter was so that it is my belief that they brought with them some sort of block or pulley which might serve as a gallows finally with a shamefaced apology for his he rose once more in order to with him they have to get an interpreter and they pitch upon this mr melas having used some other one before i was certain that alec had torn it out of the dead mans hand and almost certain that he must have thrust it into the of his dressing-gown i came away and disheartened i stared at it not knowing what was about to issue from it far away we could hear the deep of the parish clock which boomed out every quarter of an hour upon the floor close to the body was lying a singular of hard carved wood with a bone handle her rich made the white face of her companion the more worn and haggard by the contrast on the third morning however he did not appear as was his custom after to receive my instructions for the day i had come to believe that he was an with no relatives living but one day to my very great surprise he began to talk to me about his brother this girl had been to him between ourselves i think mr holmes had not quite got over his yet an instant later i heard him running down and he into my consulting-room like a man who is mad with panic i know something sir henry and perhaps i should have said it before but it was long after the that i found it out with a stout therefore though her manner had shaken me more than i cared to confess i still shook my head and declared my intention of remaining where i was the colonels body was then placed upon the sofa and a careful examination made of the of the tragedy i have already what is to occur his slippers too were gone but his were left behind the colonel had been sitting in the dining-room but hearing that his wife had returned he her in the morning-room together we into the room who were these german people and what were they doing living in this strange place having done this he drew up the windows on each side and i found to my astonishment that they were covered with paper so as to my seeing through them a depleted bank account had caused me to my holiday and as to my companion neither the country nor the sea presented the slightest attraction to him have your ready in case we should need it he is not a bad fellow though an absolute in his profession across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had during the day the trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the earth the bride who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption had sat down to breakfast with the rest when she of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room to rake this up couldnt help our poor master and its well to go when theres a lady in the case for the moment i could proceed no farther in that direction but must turn back to that other which was to be sought for among the stone huts upon the moor every day and sometimes a day i have been able but wait a moment dr watson he came himself to live with me in the character of a patient i had been casting round for some by which i could get away from his gossip but now i began to wish to hear more of it the point is of the utmost as guiding us towards the reason of the sudden quarrel my mornings work has not been since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort it was a quarter-past when i started from home and made my way across the park and so through oxford street to baker street i should be to stop the night yet it was quite certain from the stillness that we were in the country no doubt his blackmailing case is all his faculties there were several people on the at the time but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by this we have now been doing for some time and in order to help us in our we erected a hydraulic press the rapidity with which such a would take effect would also from his point of view be an advantage even after i became suspicious i found it hard to think of such a dear kind old clergyman the smoke and were enough to shake nerves of steel it was to twelve when the alarm broke out then he tried the keys in the lock but without success sherlock holmes was as good as his word for about one oclock he us in the colonels smoking-room you may not be aware that the of a mans age from his writing is one which has brought to considerable accuracy by experts several discs of metal old coins apparently such as i hold here were over the bottom of the box but it contained nothing else the chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by mr godfrey norton as our is to its coming to the eyes of his princess to me at least there was a strange between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged you may believe then that i was in my when at the appointed hour the page showed in the patient suddenly as i looked he rose from his chair and over to a bureau at the side he unlocked it and drew out one of the drawers ive had one or two little turns also with mr john clay and i with you that he is at the head of his profession come now we shall see who with you holmes took a of papers from his pocket i stood with astonishment watching him from the darkness the little which i had yet to learn of the case was told me by holmes as we travelled back next day holmes cut the and removed the transverse bar he had usually a great many for he was a public man and well known for his kind heart so that everyone who was in trouble was glad to turn to him he was tractable enough though his son was a perfect ready to blow out his own or anybody elses brains if he could have got to his revolver i have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of by studying their children it was a little room with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace after the fashion of old country-houses one morning at a little before seven oclock i was by the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room the boy was to be seen with a few broken words of gratitude the man turned but he and then came back we have him with all that he can want but that is a detail within there was a small corridor which ended in a very iron gate but i want to find out about them and who they are and what their was in playing this prank if it was a prank upon me these infernal people seem to think that there are no of property and that they can swarm where they like with their papers and their bottles a terrible scream a yell of horror and anguish burst out of the silence of the moor without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a the door of which was standing open it was to me that he could have gone away leaving all his property behind him and yet where could he be they meet they write there is a complete between them the policeman and i agreed that our best plan would be to the woman before she could get rid of the papers presuming that she had them he was acutely uneasy if he were from her for a day he had the place it was a past six when we left baker street and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in serpentine avenue it may his gossip i am still so weak that i have to as you see by dictating then sherlock holmes down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings for half an hour i sat with ears sherlock holmes and i had no difficulty in a bedroom and sitting-room at the crown inn holmes walked slowly round and each and all of them with the keenest interest miss irene or madame rather from her drive at seven why should she fight against every until it was forced from her i see him every day through my upon the roof the servants having seen it before but among the numerous curiosities in the house it is possible that it may have been overlooked still of course if you would like to out of the business there is plenty of time to do so this man strikes even but i think watson that we shall be able to strike deeper still you remember the small of uriah and bathsheba for a moment is seemed to me that there must be some radical in my calculations the sight of the safe the saucer of milk and the of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained i say normal cases because ill-health and physical weakness reproduce the of old age even when the invalid is a youth hayter was a fine old who had seen much of the world and he soon found as i had expected that holmes and he had much in common i tapped upon the floor but it sounded the same all over and there was no sign of any or crevice i had been told that if the king employed an it would certainly be you what is to me a means of is to him the merest hobby of a dilettante not another sound broke the heavy silence of the night he came up to my room one morning and into business in an instant naturally enough she ran down to tell the cook and the two women with the coachman came up into the hall and listened to the which was still raging holmes rushed at the bell-pull tore back a small shutter and plunging in his hand pulled out a photograph and a letter holmes flung open the door and in but he was out again in an instant with his hand to his throat the womans story hung coherently together and all my were unable to shake it now this puts a very weapon into our hands altogether look as i would there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head and the expression of chagrin and discontent upon his features it was a day with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens the firemen had been much at the strange arrangements which they had found within and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor too large for easy about a womans dress finally he took the in his hand and gave it a brisk tug i was the only passenger who got out there and there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy with a lantern all we wish you to do is to the machine and to let us know what is wrong with it then he threw himself down into the chair opposite and drew up his until his fingers clasped round his long thin shins when you your cry of fire it will be taken up by quite a number of people well there is nothing very in all this sitting in the i more than once heard the sound of voices raised and i had a pretty good idea what the point was which was under discussion the manor-house is as i have already said very old and only one is now inhabited we had occasion some months ago to strengthen our and borrowed for that purpose napoleons from the bank of france i caught a glimpse of rushing figures and a moment later the voice of holmes from within them that it was a false alarm his hands and feet were securely strapped together and he bore over one eye the of a violent blow i hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once but the coachman had come in and as he was me narrowly it seemed safer to wait now of course that at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms i saw in the gaslight that holmes an amused smile at this brilliant departure of mine they were by a confederate inside the house the animal has been and we have the length of its stride i slept at baker street that night and we were upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the king of bohemia rushed into the room he had been dead some days but there was no or bruise upon his person to show how he had met his dreadful end over the wide there was no sound and no movement i shall be happy to give you an upon the subject in the course of a day or two we found holmes pacing up and down in the field his chin sunk upon his and his hands thrust into his trousers pockets the machine goes readily enough but there is some stiffness in the of it and it has lost a little of its force then they will not a minute for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape i told the police last time they did it that they should these disgraceful exhibitions the object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash on one corner of the bed i was still rather over the deception which had been practised upon me but the warmth of holmess praise drove my anger from my mind nor would it be entirely with most of the words overhead that is my room at the end of the and my sons is the one beyond it but the inspector was mistaken for those criminals were not to fall into the hands of justice this incident gives zest to our investigation however and i only that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her i have told you that she had only recently recovered from an and was looking so wretchedly pale and wan that i remonstrated with her for being at work with tingling nerves but a fixed purpose i sat in the dark recess of the hut and with sombre patience for the coming of its tenant yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural and due to no disease for his eye was bright his step brisk and his bearing assured in two hours we must be on the of action i was tortured and tried to get away and was and tortured again it had set according to their account into the most expression of fear and horror which a human countenance is capable of assuming after throwing down your paper which was the which drew my attention to you you sat for half a minute with a vacant expression my guide stopped and looked about her like one who is at her end there was no slit through which a knife could be passed to the bar a heavily timbered park stretched up in a slope thickening into a grove at the highest point he could only say that if i i should hear by post the fault from what i hear may not have been on one side a frayed top-hat and a brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him we took no to hide it a meeting of the guild had been held that evening at eight and mrs barclay had over her dinner in order to be present at it i began to understand what my friend meant when he said that his brother possessed even keener that he did himself one by one the management of the noble houses of great britain is into the hands of our fair cousins from across the atlantic it was indeed a gigantic one and capable of exercising pressure holmes walked slowly taking keen note of the of the house by it he laid the of matches and the stump of a candle the lawn is thirty yards across and is only from the highway by a low wall with an iron rail above it sherlock holmes picked them up one by one and laid them along the of the table your right hand is quite a size than your left the wind was howling outside and the rain was beating and against the windows had he observed a the night before waiting for me now there is no one more easy to than a schoolmaster the photograph becomes a weapon now she was never as i think i have said ostentatiously but she was heard by the coachman chatting with the colonel in a friendly fashion there is a sofa the man is by trade a conjurer and performer going round the canteens after nightfall and giving a little at each you still smoke the arcadia mixture of your days then i was instantly and with the two footmen started off at once in search of the missing girl it is really the most and inexplicable business he looked round him with a and stealthy air as one who dreads pursuit he dived his arm down to the bottom of the and brought up a small wooden box with a sliding lid such as childrens toys are kept in thrust it into his pocket most likely never noticing that a corner of it had been left in the of the corpse i had been against you months ago a small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three opened julia went there at two years ago and met there a half-pay major of marines to whom she became engaged i was just whether i should run for it or whether i should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street its about five in the morning you know that are most common sherlock holmes had been back in his chair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a cushion but he half opened his lids now and glanced across at his visitor dont you see that the is equally valid we all sat in silence for some little time after to this extraordinary narrative from one of these i picked a battle-axe and then leaving my behind me i crept on tiptoe down the passage and peeped in at the open door it would be a coroner indeed who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work far away came the sharp of a boot striking upon a stone he had to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which i have ever listened all was exactly as i left it save only that the which had been committed to my care had been taken from the desk on which they lay you dont with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time running up i its brains out and it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck i had let myself go and was by the hands to the sill when his blow fell i had not quite understood until that instant how my mission was sherlock holmes was not very communicative during the long and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon i rubbed one of them on my sleeve however and it glowed afterwards like a in the dark hollow of my hand i had never seen my friends face so or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation i entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman by the table but his next took a weight from my mind i clambered out upon the sill but i hesitated to jump until i should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who me i could tell from his expression that he was on a hot and yet i could not in the least imagine in what direction his inferences were leading him we stepped as it were right out of the carriage and into the hall so that i failed to catch the most glance of the front of the house a vague feeling of began to steal over me i have established a right of way through the of old middletons park slap across it sir within a hundred yards of his own front door we are in an enemys country an inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the of standing on it which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator the other was a very small dark fellow with his hat pushed back and several under his arm on the other hand we brought to the surface an of a most unexpected kind and what deep and earnest purpose can he have which for such a trial evidently therefore alec cunningham had lied when he said that the two men were when the shot was fired add to that the length of neck and head and you get a not much less than two feet long probably more if there is any tail i fainted when it was done and i think that i must have been for a long time two hours passed slowly away and then suddenly just at the of eleven a single bright light shone out right in front of us in a of anger however caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence if i have to call in the aid of the police you will find how you are compromised the place we want must be near that line he started me off upon the letter a and then he left me but he would in from time to time to see that all was right with me outside the sun was low and the west was blazing with scarlet and gold at the moment i was simply conscious that i was in the presence of a very handsome woman and that she was me the reasons for my visit the shutters cut off the least of light and we waited in absolute darkness such an could not be kept secret that is quite up now though indeed it was obvious from the first within was a small room in which the three of us could hardly get at one time the french or the russian embassy would pay an immense sum to the contents of these papers a few minutes later we were joined by a short stout man whose olive face and coal-black hair his southern origin though his speech was that of an educated englishman possibly i had taken no since i had been upon the moor which had not been observed and reported mr melas is a by extraction as i understand and he is a remarkable linguist near the foot of the bed stood a dish of and a carafe of water i noticed her pass but i had no special reason for her a few good and the reputation which i had won in the hospital brought me rapidly to the front and during the last few years i have made him a rich man for years ive been dreaming of the bright green and the hedges of england then he turned down the and we were left in darkness some chalk over the waistcoat pocket were the only signs of billiards which i could see in one of them he was plainly but neatly and his age i should judge would be nearer forty than thirty i have no wish to you to anything without your having it all laid before you he was not remarkable for intelligence and his answers were frequently which i attributed to his limited acquaintance with our language they undoubtedly showed that the was much deeper than was at first conjectured sherlock holmess was soon fulfilled and in a dramatic fashion suddenly a door opened at the other end of the and a long golden bar of light shot out in our direction out of this landing opened the and several bedrooms including those of mr cunningham and his son one of them fired a shot the other dropped and the rushed across the garden and over the hedge as we passed it holmes to my unutterable astonishment leaned over in front of me and deliberately the whole thing over i rang the bell therefore to him an elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came out at a side door there are many men in london you know who some from some from misanthropy have no wish for the company of their fellows the sun had set and was settling over the moor he might slip away from us in the of regent street but it would puzzle him to do so upon the lonely moor i expect that within an hour will come to a head besides this outlay he must be prepared to keep himself for some years and to hire a presentable carriage and horse i confess that i felt easier in my mind when after following holmes example and off my shoes i found myself inside the bedroom for all they cared it might have been me instead of my which these rascals burned at the stake we will be into the sitting-room to wait for the lady but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph i have no doubt at all that a family can be traced in these two specimens of writing they saw that i must know all about it you see and the sudden change from absolute to complete despair made them perfectly desperate in an instant i was with a blow and bound hand and foot i rushed across the flung open the window and looked out it was of course of the very first importance that they should not be of the existence of this paper otherwise they would naturally destroy it without delay the probability was therefore that she was the truth or at least a part of the truth then he did the same with the with which the chamber was panelled his clothes his watch and even his money were in his room but the black which he usually wore was missing to the logician all things should be seen exactly as they are and to ones self is as much a departure from truth as to exaggerate ones own powers with an apology for my intrusion i was about to when holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me there are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the force and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is to you at two oclock he bade me good-day complimented me upon the amount that i had and locked the door of the office after me its a world and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all five little livid spots the of four fingers and a thumb were printed upon the white wrist you see at the commencement of an investigation it is something to know that your is in close contact with some one who for good or evil has an exceptional nature i have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to it if the lady her husband she does not love your majesty the thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door his way past her but she threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back i thought of the convict out upon the bleak cold moor hes in too but hes not a convict as far as i can make out his characteristic talk with its keen of detail and subtle power of inference held me amused and enthralled he found that the which covered it was just too heavy for a man to move unaided i was well aware that nothing but business of importance would have brought him to me at such an hour so i patiently until he should come round to it when he raised his face again i was to see that his cheek was tinged with color and his eyes as bright as before his illness the brother scribbled a note upon a leaf of his and ringing the bell he handed it to the waiter i did not know about a projected between herself and her husband the shock has made her but i understand that she was never very bright i could see at a glance that she was with fear and the sight sent a chill to my own heart as he turned towards us the of the light showed me that he was wearing glasses but i see that the enemys have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light there was nothing markedly abnormal in any of these conditions which with my former experiences the butler was standing very but very collected before us the book however had been left in the billiard-room so i on my dressing-gown and started off to get it when a woman thinks that her house is on fire her is at once to rush to the thing which she values most convinced that some tragedy had the coachman rushed to the door and strove to force it while scream after scream issued from within if you will only come around to the east gate you it will very much surprise you and be of the greatest to you and also to annie morrison you see that we hold all the cards and we have only to fear some sudden act of on their part a vague feeling of misfortune impressed me i was of a dull pain my grip loosened and i fell into the garden below it is that you may even have read some account of the matter when a does go wrong he is the first of criminals the ceiling was only a foot or two above my head and with my hand i could feel its hard rough surface the ashes of a fire were in a rude grate your mission today has itself and yet i could almost wish that you had not left his side it is a wild night indoors and what must it be in a hut upon the moor there was no save a little pallet bed a small table and a basketful of linen for answer holmes back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitors knee he was unable however to make his way in and the were too distracted with fear to be of any assistance to him there was something subtly wrong with the face some coarseness of expression some perhaps of eye some looseness of lip which marred its perfect beauty i heard a gentle sound of and then all was silent once more though the smell grew stronger but sometimes a letter may be even when burned and that was how a great scandal threatened to the kingdom of bohemia and how the best plans of mr sherlock holmes were beaten by a womans wit at the time the circumstances made a deep upon me and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect he was a solicitor and was my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready as a rule when i have heard some indication of the course of events i am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory his brain is as as his fingers and though we meet signs of him at every turn we never know where to find the man himself we could see the in the wood where it had been pushed in a vague pathway among the boulders led to the dilapidated which served as a door the freckles started out on the face colonel stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door i shall not keep you waiting an instant  said he and into the darkness an important has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders you have at least the satisfaction of knowing that for thirty years of his life his bitterly reproached him for this wicked deed i rushed towards it and pulled at the handle but it was quite and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves hullo i yelled hullo two hansoms were standing at the door and as i entered the i heard the sound of voices from above it was a little past six when i so i went first to have my wound dressed and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here he was very willing to have a holiday so we the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement they have given up the there and he can lie quiet until the ship is ready for him the king may do what he will without from one whom he has cruelly wronged the door at the bottom was but unlocked i found him much over the disappearance of his little spaniel we live very quietly sir the three of us and we keep a over our heads and pay our debts if we do nothing more but the evening has brought a with it were it not for the wound upon my hand all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream surely the explanation of all this could not be as as she would have me believe i was a happy and successful man mr holmes and on the eve of being married when a sudden and dreadful misfortune all my prospects in life they had each been stabbed it seems and the hungarian police were of opinion that they had and had inflicted mortal injuries upon each other my wife had already gone upstairs and the sound of the of the hall door some time before told me that the servants had also retired i am an as perhaps my neighbor there has told you let me pass i say he her to one side and rushing to the window cut at me with his heavy weapon holmess voice as he answered it is a little place near the of oxfordshire and within seven miles of reading hell be cut up over this for the man has been in his for years and was a good servant i am a light sleeper and it has me it is probable that he will be away all day and that there would be nothing to you he was deadly pale and terribly with the protruding brilliant eyes of a man whose spirit was greater than his strength the house was just such as i had it from sherlock holmes succinct description but the locality appeared to be less private than i expected i sprang from my bed a shawl round me and rushed into the corridor the law is upon his side and every day i am by the possibility that he may force me to live with him i have seen it on him and could to it there were two guides given us to with an oak and an elm the thieves the library and got very little for their pains if my hair would only change heres a nice little crib all ready for me to step into it was a quiet little plainly room with a round table in the centre on which several german books were scattered he had ceased to moan as we laid him down and a glance showed me that for him at least our had come too late holmes drew one of the into a corner and sat silent while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down taking in every detail of the apartment it is that this fellow could have made two such vindictive enemies as these appear to be without knowing of it then once more the footsteps approached and a fell across the opening of the hut i took off the and blew out the lamp for the water was spurting over the floor there sitting together in the i told holmes of my conversation with the lady but not one word shall they have from me and i you to secrecy also dr watson we even them as far as reading but could get no farther for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands pray interrupt me if there is any which is not perfectly clear to you it did wonders both in the crimea and the mutiny and has since that time itself upon every possible occasion in an instant the three of us had torn them away from him and holmes staggered to his feet very and evidently greatly exhausted she writhed as one who is in terrible and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed there could be no question that the most distinctive and suggestive point in the case was the disappearance of the door-key no one could pass these if they were bolted i had no to tell the baronet what i had learned about mrs lyons upon the evening before for dr mortimer remained with him at cards until it was very late and yet this new factor must surely arrest his attention and his interest a coachman and two form the staff of servants i cannot recall when i have seen anything so fine he took a step backward cocked his head on one side and at my hair until i felt quite bashful the more formal we made the the less information we might obtain we hired a hansom and in half an hour we were at the which had been given to us it was evident that a or strong knife had been thrust in and the lock forced back with it sherlock holmes had listened to this long narrative with an which showed me that his interest was keenly aroused ferguson appeared to be a and silent man but i could see from the little that he said that he was at least a fellow-countryman what is the of it all the letter had as i said been and it was not all legible palmer and pritchard were among the of their profession it is to you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you a young and unknown man a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession it had wandered on to the and had never come back i could only move it slightly and it was with the of one of the constables that i succeeded at last in carrying it to one side now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in of a ventilator is made a is hung and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies you say yourself that the horse was fresh and when you got in i tried to puzzle it out but gave it up in despair and set the matter until night should bring an explanation suddenly amid all the of the gale there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman if you leave you your whole position forever however i all fears to the winds ate a hearty supper drove to paddington and started off having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue even without the lens you will by the scratches on this ward where the pressure was applied it cost me something in foolscap and i had pretty nearly filled a with my writings round one of his hands he had a wrapped which was mottled all over with bloodstains holmes dashed into the crowd to the lady but just as he reached her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground with the blood running freely down his face the ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly open and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture in an instant it was that we had at last come upon the true place and that we had not been the only people to visit the spot recently a greek friend had come to see him upon business he said and as he could speak nothing but his own tongue the services of an were indispensable then i put out my hand and was about to shake the man who was still soundly when a bell over his head rang loudly and he woke with a start my attention was speedily as i have already remarked to you to this ventilator and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed i keep it only to myself and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future i dressed hurriedly for i knew by experience that railway were seldom trivial and hastened downstairs he insisted upon my climbing into his dog-cart and he gave me a homeward right in front of the house upon the left-hand side of the drive there stood a patriarch among one of the most magnificent trees that i have ever seen his chin was upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling then my senses and my voice came back to me while a weight of responsibility seemed in an instant to be lifted from my soul it looked as if the pair might take an departure and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part the bell-rope hangs from the just to the right of my desk he broke the seal and over the contents whatever she may have deserved one could not her to go hopelessly to the bad before entering holmes made an of the door which had been forced suddenly however as i ran a dizziness and sickness came over me as to the photograph your may rest in peace look at this hiding out yonder and watching and waiting the lady against whom naturally the strongest suspicion rested was to her room still in a state of insensibility it must have been a very long time for the moon had sunk and a bright morning was when i came to myself what passion of hatred can it be which leads a man to in such a place at such a time if you examine this scrap with attention you will come to the conclusion that the man with the stronger hand wrote all his words first leaving for the other to fill up he sat at my side in silence all the time and i was aware more than once when i in his direction that he was looking at me with great intensity their reason for choosing so unusual an hour for a was obviously to insure that there should be no other patient in the waiting-room a maid across and threw open the window at waterloo we were fortunate in a train for leatherhead where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely surrey lanes when i went upstairs with him he pointed to several upon the light carpet here we our cab and made our way up the drive together then suddenly he plunged forward my hand and congratulated me warmly on my success but here an unexpected and singular presented itself both cases dr watson and both in my favour besides remember that she had to use it within a few days i am sure that if you my name they would be happy to show it to you suddenly however he started me on the shoulder and pointed over the meadows she then called for miss morrison a young lady who lives in the next and the two went off together to their meeting we are at present doctor as no doubt you have divined in the cellar of the city branch of one of the london banks theres not a man would cross it after sundown if he was for it yet with all this you made me what you wanted to know holmes and i rushed out and round the angle of the house with toller behind us i heard that barclay had married nancy and that he was rapidly in the regiment but even that did not make me speak twice he struck at the chamber door without any from within the king at him in amazement i handed him my pouch and he seated himself opposite to me and for some time in silence he carries some about with him in that box about which the landlady seemed to be in considerable trepidation for she had never seen an animal like it i could see that she was pretty and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark i knew that it was a rich material he had started swiftly over the moor and i had followed at his heels the new will have come however before the story can be safely told i determined to wait until i got back to town before my story to the police his face set hard and a baleful light up in his grey eyes as it is i feel that young mans grip on my throat now and the father has twisted my round in the effort to get the paper out of my hand if the former she had probably the photograph to his keeping the crate upon which i sit contains napoleons packed between of lead foil i had and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when i heard a muttered exclamation in german and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me her story got about and several of the people here did something to enable her to an honest living he had his hand under the others arm as they entered and helped him to a chair with a which one would hardly have expected from his appearance he was by a little elderly gentleman who was introduced to me as the mr acton whose house had been the scene of the original burglary my stepfather has no opposition to the match and we are to be married in the course of the spring it is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should have your curiosity i knew that it was my voice in the evening i put on my waterproof and i walked far upon the moor full of dark imaginings the rain beating upon my face and the wind whistling about my ears the proceedings against the page broke down for want of and the brook street mystery as it was called has never until now been fully dealt with in any public print it was nearly between the oak and the house if you cannot keep me after what has passed then for gods sake let me give you notice and leave in a as if of my own free will i lounged up the side aisle like any other who has dropped into a church i am only of course giving you the leading now of my examination of the paper therefore something had occurred between and nine oclock which had completely altered her feelings towards him if i could get his it might save me a long and weary hunt i could only check it by if she had indeed instituted divorce proceedings against her husband at or about the time of the tragedy with these two facts in my possession i felt that either my intelligence or my courage must be deficient if i could not some further light upon these dark places it will give him the for which he has been seeking he has and he has knowledge then when i a light upon them close in swiftly but we have more reasons than that for supposing it he was once a in the north of england she listened for an instant up her hands with a despairing gesture and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come his dress was quiet and sombre a black frock-coat dark trousers and a touch of about his necktie the lady looked quickly up with an gleam in her hazel eyes we are but her from injuring another there were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor while the plaster was off the walls and the damp was breaking through in green unhealthy blotches it might or might not the occupant perhaps she might escape every night for a week but sooner or later she must fall a victim i measured out the distance which brought me almost to the wall of the house and i a peg into the spot neither address nor is attached to it the twilight had in and the moon was shining brightly in the sky before my narrative was finished but the girl held true to me and it seemed that i would have had her when the broke out and all hell was loose in the country he was of a sickly color and his thin sandy hair seemed to bristle up with the of his emotion there was a chair just under the lamp and the elderly man that i should sit in it it was the clank of the levers and the swish of the cylinder until after the of fire i had not a suspicion he does not say so but i can read it from his soothing and averted eyes the house stands in its own grounds but the west side of it is not more than thirty from the high-road you are to ask the questions mr melas and he will the answers at one side of this was a squat brass-bound wooden box the of which was hinged upwards with this curious old-fashioned key projecting from the lock he turned the two best of the first floor into a sitting-room and bedroom for himself it was almost dark before we found ourselves in pall mall at the of mr melas a young man very pale and worn was lying upon a sofa near the open window through which came the rich of the garden and the balmy summer air as i ran down the passage my sisters door was unlocked and slowly upon its hinges one side of the window was open which i understand was quite usual in the and he passed without difficulty into the room it was an old door and gave at once before our united strength and yet it would be the treachery to holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me he is a man of no physical courage as they are well aware from their the other night you have all the cleverness which makes a man his secret was a shameful one and he could not bring himself to it nothing had been touched or taken but there were the footprints to that the intrusion was an undoubted fact and into her which was the very room which i suspected and this was the singular case of the grecian interpreter the of which is still involved in some mystery i suppose there would be no chance of a back his heart was it appears and he needed constant medical supervision but now your thoughts went back to beecher and you looked hard across as if you were the character in his features but incredulity and indifference were evidently my cards and then again sir we were both of us very of sir charles as we well might be considering all that he has done for us as it was he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to england a and disappointed man he was off in one of those outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone i made no allusion to what had passed and with some curiosity to see how he would cover his disgrace within twenty-four hours i was in his sick-room and was to find that there was nothing formidable in his symptoms these good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as as a gold-mine then mr alec ran out and beside the wounded man it was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was by the butler and the footman while there she had met a young man named harold latimer who had acquired an over her and had eventually persuaded her to fly with him i ran to her and threw my arms round her but at that moment her seemed to give way and she fell to the ground for a moment or two i sat hardly able to believe my ears he is a bit of a don juan and you can imagine that for a man like him it is not a very part to play in a quiet country district i will read it to you and in return you must turn over these and let me have whatever bears upon the matter he was a man of singular habits company and very seldom going out as i gave a last glance around i saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward he appeared to be for he carried his head low and walked with his knees bent the woman was standing in the aperture the darkness of the hall behind her the light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face luck had been against us again and again in this but now at last it came to my aid i rose and examined carefully the different of wood which were scattered round the floor and yet i all appearance of interest once again i had reached that dead wall which seemed to be across every path by which i tried to get at the object of my mission it hadnt pulled up before she out of the hall door and into it in an instant his strange began to move and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent as we walked home together holmes stopped at a office and sent off several wires a splendid with fine old timber surrounds the house and the lake to which my client had referred lay close to the avenue about two hundred yards from the building it was not until we had reached home that i began to the true state of affairs for that matter and possibly other large towns were within that radius so the place might not be so secluded after all he was not generally popular among the undergraduates though it always seemed to me that what was set down as pride was really an to cover extreme natural diffidence i often take advantage of the which it gives it was a delicate point and it the field of my inquiry he has been very to us and hardly a day has passed that he has not called at the hall to see how we were getting on it was certainly more roomy than the ordinary four-wheeled disgrace to london and the though frayed were of rich quality no case however in which holmes was engaged has ever the value of his analytical methods so clearly or has impressed those who were associated with him so deeply but then when i found how i had myself i began to think i am a man to fall foul of it was worth an effort to find out and for that we all went up to the house then suddenly another sound became a very gentle soothing sound like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle no sound came from within and at the silence holmes face over the trap drove on and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the was lit in one of the sitting-rooms it gave even my nerves a shudder to look at it at first he was very to come but on second thoughts it seemed to both of us that if i went alone the results might be better you may then walk to the end of the street and i will you in ten minutes it was a thing to be in the power of this spiteful old busybody for many years i have been the chief greek in london and my name is very well known in the hotels i had seen enough of the contrary nature of the old sinner to understand that any strong of interest would be the surest way to stop his confidences i trust that i am not more than my neighbours but i was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with sherlock holmes he had been carried down by two persons one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones the inspector had his lantern and by its light we could see the two doors the curtain the lamp and the suit of japanese mail as he had described them the cries which had down into a hoarse inarticulate shouting came from the room which we had first visited i assure you sir henry that in a very few days the necessary arrangements will have been made and he will be on his way to america i staggered to my feet and ran with her along the and down a winding stair you of course saw that in the street was an accomplice she left her room therefore and came into mine where she sat for some time about her approaching wedding for gods sake sir i of you not to let the police know that he is still on the moor the words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room a very fat and burly man with a heavy in his hand nor was the fact of the being on the back of his head a fatal objection to this as he might have turned to avoid the blow god help those who wander into the great now for even the firm uplands are becoming a morass suddenly there was the gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator which vanished immediately but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal the lord st simon marriage and its termination have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves we both sat in silence for some little time after to this extraordinary narrative when i had made it clear to them i returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to my own curiosity i made excellent and they are only delayed one day upon their way but there were signs that i had not come upon a false scent the furniture was scattered about in every direction with dismantled shelves and open drawers as if the lady had hurriedly them before her flight i could not see her clearly enough to know more than that she was tall and graceful with black hair and in some sort of loose white gown peering in we could see that the only light in the room came from a dull blue flame which from a small brass tripod in the centre she had been terribly immediately after his disappearance if i lay on my face the would come upon my spine and i shuddered to think of that dreadful snap the garden and the stables of course have a staff sorry to see that youve had the british in the house about nine oclock the light among the trees was and all was dark in the direction of the manor house the glass smashed into a thousand pieces and the fruit about into every corner of the room my companion was a powerful broad-shouldered young fellow and apart from the i should not have had the slightest chance in a struggle with him i shall call with the king and with you if you care to come with us i took out my and laid it on the corner of the table the air had turned and we withdrew into the hut for warmth i should like however to understand a little more what it is that you wish me to do the medical evidence showed conclusively that death was to apoplexy but he will never trouble in this country again i should not wish a smarter mr holmes and i know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what i am able to give him i have no reason to be of it a low moaning sound was coming from over our heads ten steps with each foot took me along parallel with the wall of the house and again i marked my with a peg i came in by train this morning and on at paddington as to where i might find a doctor a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here besides we must be for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits he held up a piece of white cardboard about the of a sheet of note-paper his life was but in one respect he was regularity itself she married an artist named lyons who came on the moor the colonel possessed a varied collection of brought from the different countries in which he had fought and it is conjectured by the police that his club was among his trophies you can hardly realize then how i found it at first and how long i had to wait before i succeeded in making any headway the flush had in an instant and a deathly face was before me at last she looked up with something and defiant in her manner it had been or torn right out from the roots i could however see that his face was pale and filled with horror and loathing his broad black hat his baggy trousers his white tie his smile and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as mr john hare alone could have equalled it was the same good friend whose warning i had so rejected i have only one other incident to record upon this and melancholy day each daughter can claim an of pounds in case of marriage the instant that i had crossed the threshold the door slammed behind us and i heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away of course he must the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim on the table stood a with the shutter half open throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe the door of which was ajar the photograph is in a behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull he laughed very heartily with a high note leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides the carpet prevents any of a trap-door and the ceiling is of the ordinary whitewashed kind evidently because he saw something in it which had all those generations of country squires and from which he expected some personal advantage he unwound the and held out his hand altogether there are eight maids the the butler two footmen and a boy i simply want your about a hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of gear i have one of my baker street boys mounting guard over him who would stick to him like a go where he might we were at breakfast when the colonels rushed in with all his propriety shaken out of him he had trained it probably by the use of the which we saw to return to him when summoned i rushed from the room on to the landing i have a few thousands to invest dye see and i think ill them in you if there was one there might be others so i looked round the hut in search of them his eyes rolled upwards his features writhed in agony and with a suppressed groan he on his face upon the ground half a if you do it in twenty minutes its not a very large and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living she knocked without receiving any answer and even turned the but only to find that the door was locked upon the inside all my instincts rose up against that laugh at eleven oclock she rose to leave me but she at the door and looked back so tall was he that his hat brushed the cross bar of the doorway and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side these were all which had to be taken into consideration and yet none of them got quite to the heart of the matter i implored the to let me out but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries i swear that another day shall not have passed before i have done all that man can do to the heart of the mystery this must be the where the stranger lurked my friend hardly glanced up as i entered and i seeing that his must be of importance seated myself in an arm-chair and waited would she not have made an queen when i saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the at st jamess hall i felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down in normal cases one can place a man in his true with tolerable confidence then i rather imprudently wished you and started for the temple to see my husband i had risen from my seat and was knocking out the ashes of my when i suddenly heard the clang of the bell these walls are and it is conceivable that his shriek if he had time to utter one was unheard one other detail of interest was by jane stewart the housemaid in my haste i thrust the key into my pocket and my stick while i was chasing teddy who had run up the curtain together they would come at night to the cellar and their united would suffice to raise the stone everything was in my favour and i swore that it should not be through lack of energy or perseverance that i should miss the chance which fortune had thrown in my way throwing aside my i closed my hand upon the butt of my revolver and walking swiftly up to the door i looked in once or twice we drifted into talk and i can remember that more than once he a keen interest in my methods of observation and inference for myself my term of service in india had me to stand heat better than cold and a thermometer of was no hardship it is not a common among employers in this age but a singular brought us to a standstill there he was sure enough a small urchin with a little upon his shoulder toiling slowly up the hill i think that there was some more tangible cause holmes had away but he came back in a few minutes again and again i her but i could never get past that point holmes and the inspector led us round it until we came to the side gate which is by a stretch of garden from the hedge which lines the road all you have to do is just to out your chair in the consulting-room as he from the hook it was exaggerated and intensified until he was scarce human in his appearance that is his fault but on the whole hes a good worker he was a dashing jovial old soldier in his usual mood but there were occasions on which he seemed to show himself capable of considerable and vindictiveness i fastened the rod on end marked out the direction of the shadow and it it is a perfectly overpowering and i have more than once taken advantage of it mr cunningham had just got into bed and mr alec was a pipe in his dressing-gown it is evident therefore that if both girls had married this beauty would have had a pittance while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent you must not come what may your task is to that some three hours or so we were all in the train together bound from reading to the little berkshire village your interview with the lady has cleared the very much the portly client puffed out his with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat it could only be a small one or it would have been upon at the coroners inquiry she had thrown them in there at the first opportunity to the last trace of her crime the country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world for we and jolted terribly it struck cold to our hearts and i stood at holmes and he at me until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose even my of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my impatience the light at the top was suddenly whisked out and from the came a reedy quivering voice as to reward my profession is its own reward but you are at liberty to whatever expenses i may be put to at the time which suits you best that frightful cry turned the blood to in my veins i have told you now the whole truth and if i withheld it from the police it is because i did not then the danger in which my dear friend stood i paid the man and into the church sherlock holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over with his eyes brightly between puckered lids and first of all we must our positions all my unspoken instincts my suspicions suddenly took shape and centred upon the naturalist we shall just be in time to have a little with him besides i knew that my was a good man and that he would see to anything that turned up i have a of the questions and answers here if you care to run your eye over them during my long and acquaintance with mr sherlock holmes i had never heard him refer to his relations and hardly ever to his own early life i act from a sense of public duty she stared at us with defiant eyes and then suddenly me an expression of absolute astonishment came over her face his whole face sharpened away into nose and chin and the skin of his cheeks was quite tense over his outstanding bones ive never a word about it yet to mortal man that cold ironical voice could belong to but one man in all the world my heart is already since i have confided my trouble to you and your had been given me my clothes were all with dew and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb the walls were carefully sounded and were shown to be quite solid all round and the was also thoroughly examined with the same result his aversion to women and his disinclination to form new friendships were both typical of his character but not more so than his complete suppression of every reference to his own people he was all right as far as money went but in his he had given her what looked like a bad florin the duke his father was at one time for foreign affairs if she were ill-used then at any risks i was to go back to her assistance my poor friends face had suddenly the most dreadful expression more than one person fainted at the mere sight of him so was the effect these are men and though we shall take them at a disadvantage they may do us some harm unless we are careful all day today the poured down rustling on the ivy and dripping from the eaves you will observe that the hour upon it is the very time at which the poor fellow met his fate he proved to be a blackguard and her my companion let down the window and i caught a glimpse of a low doorway with a lamp burning above it he will not even go out of his way to his own solutions and would rather be considered wrong than take the trouble to prove himself right matters were in this state when a new development quite drew our attention away from the mystery he did the letter it seemed to me that a careful examination of the room and the lawn might possibly some traces of this mysterious individual beside it lay some cooking utensils and a bucket of water colonel lysander stark out and as i followed after him pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us it appears to be a fragment from a larger sheet it was not that holmes changed his costume and holmes came to be realised for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman the sinister german or the morose englishman the least appearance of struck fire out of the old autocrat the lash however was upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord and yet if it were on the i wonder that you did not hear it also this press as i have already has got out of order and we wish your advice upon the subject of course if they had been merely after they would at least have made some attempt to search for it i rose and making my escaped from the house in one of these the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards while the roof was partly caved in a picture of ruin there are lonely houses over the moor and he is a fellow who would stick at nothing my coffee had not yet come and i wondered what was the cause of the could be it brought me to the very of the old door as i left the i happened to meet rachel howells the maid one piece about three feet in length had a very marked indentation at one end while several were flattened at the sides as if they had been by some considerable weight they inherit blood by direct descent and tudor on the distaff side but to my when i came to look round me neither house nor garden were to be seen all red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of years are eligible then she open a door which led into a bedroom through the window of which the moon was shining brightly otherwise your energy and attention must be instead of being concentrated we had a small this morning after breakfast my practice had steadily and as i happened to live at no very great distance from paddington station i got a few patients from among the officials it rained hard this afternoon as you know and my were the only people who called now on the other side of this wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open the unknown might be lurking there or he might be on the moor my submission him and led him to further confidences i should like for example to see how far the of the bedrooms command the front from north south east and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had into the city to answer the advertisement someone in the next room had a dark-lantern having found nothing they tried to divert suspicion by making it appear to be an ordinary to which end they carried off whatever they could lay their hands upon i should not go too far if i were to say that there was a general at that time that a distinguished career lay before me i have made a small of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject we laid him upon the drawing-room and having dispatched the sobered toller to bear the news to his wife i did what i could to relieve his pain your eyes turned across to the unframed portrait of henry ward beecher which upon the top of your books it will end in my being into the house you will remember that on hearing the sound of the she descended and returned with the other servants when he reached the i saw the ragged uncouth figure outlined for an instant against the cold blue sky he went out again therefore through the window and having the help of a policeman and of a medical man he returned you were dwelling upon the sadness and horror and waste of life i shall stand behind this crate and do you conceal behind those i put myself in the mans place and having first gauged his intelligence i try to how i should myself have proceeded under the same circumstances everything which had been disconnected before began at once to its true place and i had a shadowy presentiment of the whole sequence of events now and then i some remark to break the monotony of the journey but the colonel answered only in monosyllables and the conversation soon flagged at first i thought that she had not me but as i bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which i shall never forget oh my god but we have to be careful for we have been deceived by wigs and once by paint holmes waved away the though his smile showed that it had pleased him a man always finds it hard to realize that he may have finally lost a womans love however badly he may have her from within he a crumpled piece of paper and old-fashioned brass key a peg of wood with a ball of string attached to it and three rusty old disks of metal i should not be very much if this were he whose step i hear now upon the stair i thought that she had but she recovered herself by a supreme effort mr alec stopped to see if he could help the dying man and so the got clean away i stooped under the rude lintel and there he sat upon a outside his gray eyes dancing with amusement as they fell upon my astonished features the roadway was blocked with the stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians what was this nocturnal and why should i go armed i will never so much as the same air with you again the last red had faded away in the west and night had settled upon the moor the money which my mother had left was enough for all our and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness he would try by a few attentions to make his peace with the girl howells and then would her as his accomplice the telescope a instrument mounted upon a tripod stood upon the flat leads of the house we know that there is who has the facts if we can only find her i sprang up and the lamp but nothing was to be seen in the room i rushed forward fell down clapped my hand to my face and became a spectacle half way down this is a small landing with another passage running into it at right angles i placed my revolver cocked upon the top of the case behind which i crouched they were a and a rough one too i interpret all languages or nearly all but as i am a greek by birth and with a grecian name it is with that particular that i am principally associated it was locked but the had been left on the outside there was an old ticking loudly somewhere in the passage but otherwise everything was deadly still the paper over each window was to light and a blue curtain was drawn across the glass work in front the same was on duty i found as had been there when i arrived i was feeling and stupid partly from my dinner and also from the effects of a long days work i give you my word upon that his eyes looked malignantly at me and his gray whiskers bristled like those of an cat holmes shrugged his shoulders with a glance of comic resignation towards the colonel and the talk away into less dangerous channels i endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it but there came a sudden in my ears and next moment i fell in a dead faint among the rose-bushes dont you dare to with my affairs the man leaned over and pulled up the front of a kind of in the corner then again i have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red or dark red or anything but real bright fiery red the first left by mrs lyons was one of extreme beauty during my i had been intimately associated with a lad named percy phelps who was of much the same age as myself though he was two classes ahead of me on the contrary for a small street in a quiet it was remarkably animated the younger had left us but he suddenly returned through another door leading with him a gentleman in some sort of loose dressing-gown who moved slowly towards us he loved to lie in the very centre of five millions of people with his stretching out and running through them responsive to every little rumor or suspicion of unsolved crime i threw myself against the door and dragged with my nails at the lock if i were to see my father in one of these dreadful seizures i am that i should never survive it the incidents of the next few days are graven upon my recollection and i can tell them without reference to the notes made at the time i would never a banker mr holmes they seize him and use violence towards him in order to make him sign some papers to make over the girls of which he may be trustee to them the wound upon the dead man was as i was able to determine with absolute confidence fired from a at the distance of something over four yards but i hear the of wheels she was about to renew her entreaties when a door slammed and the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs the point under discussion was how far any singular gift in an individual was due to his and how far to his own early training why should she hand it over to else it told how two who had been traveling with a woman had met with a tragic end i am going through the first and we can have some lunch on the way from this he took a paper and returning to his seat he flattened it out beside the taper on the edge of the table and began to it with minute attention the station-master had not his speech before we were all hastening in the direction of the fire ferguson remained outside and the ushered me in it is most unusual suddenly however an incident opened up quite a new prospect to me he was off like a shot and got away i had myself extinguished the lamp and the door before coming to bed the ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston and it comes down with the force of many upon this metal floor nothing would induce me to help the in any way then i walked across to the window hoping that i might catch some glimpse of the country-side but an oak heavily barred was folded across it mr jabez wilson started up in his chair with his upon the paper but his eyes upon my companion but i have heard mr holmes that you can see deeply into the wickedness of the human heart in my inmost heart i believed that i could where others failed and now i had the opportunity to test myself she had into the lake a bag containing some curious contents rain had fallen on the night before and we examined the and the paths all round the house but in vain nowhere was there any trace of that lonely man whom i had seen on the same spot two before it was a quarter to ten before we reached london bridge and half past before the four of us on the beckenham platform the shape of some monstrous villainy half seen half loomed through the darkness which had girt me so long they were the only signs of human life which i could see save only those prehistoric which lay thickly upon the slopes of the hills the bedrooms in this are on the ground floor the sitting-rooms being in the central block of the buildings our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace british tradesman obese and slow the terror of his face lay in his eyes however steel gray and glistening coldly with a malignant inexorable in their depths it is your commonplace crimes which are really puzzling just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify on the last occasion he had that if my friend would only come with me he would be glad to extend his hospitality to him also
